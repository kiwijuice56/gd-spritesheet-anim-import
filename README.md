# gd-spritesheet-animation-plugin
 A godot plugin to generate animations from spritesheets

## How to use
On the main github page for this repository, click `Code > Download ZIP`, then extract the folder. Open the extracted folder and copy the nested `gd-spritesheet-anim-import-main` folder. Paste this folder into your godot project under `res://addons/`. Finally, navigate to `Project > Project Settings > Plugins` and enable the plugin.

Once enabled, you can generate animations by first selecting a Sprite2D and then ctrl-selecting an AnimationPlayer. If done correctly, a new dock will appear on the top right with settings for your animation
